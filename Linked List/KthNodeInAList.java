Problem Description

You are given a singly linked list and an integer K.
Your task is to access the node at the K-th index (0-based indexing)
in the list and return its value.

If the index is out of bounds, return -1.

Problem Constraints
  K <= 10^6

Input Format
  The first argument is a pointer to the head of the linked list.
  The second argument is a positive integer K.

Output Format
  Return a single integer representing the value of the K-th node
  in the linked list.

Example Input
  1 -> 3 -> 5 -> 7 -> 9
  K = 2

Example Output
  5

Example Explanation
  The element at index 2 (0-based indexing) is 5,
  which is the 3rd element in the linked list.
