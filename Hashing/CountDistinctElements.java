Problem Description

Given an array A consisting of N integers, your task is to determine
the number of unique (distinct) elements present in the array.

Two elements are considered the same if their values are equal.

Problem Constraints
  1 <= N <= 100000
  1 <= A[i] <= 10^9

Input Format
  The first argument is an integer array A.

Output Format
  Return the number of distinct elements in the array.

Example Input

Input 1:
  A = [3, 4, 3, 6, 6]

Input 2:
  A = [3, 3, 3, 9, 0, 1, 0]

Example Output

Output 1:
  3

Output 2:
  4

Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
  The distinct values in the array are {3, 4, 6}. Total = 3.

Explanation 2:
  The distinct values in the array are {3, 9, 0, 1}. Total = 4.
