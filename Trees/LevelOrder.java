/*
Problem Description

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values
(i.e., from left to right, level by level).


Problem Constraints

1 <= number of nodes <= 10^5


Input Format

The first and only argument is the root node of the binary tree A.


Output Format

Return a 2D integer array denoting the level order traversal of the given
binary tree.


Example Input

Input 1:
        3
       / \
      9  20
        /  \
       15   7

Input 2:
        1
       / \
      6   2
         /
        3


Example Output

Output 1:
[
  [3],
  [9, 20],
  [15, 7]
]

Output 2:
[
  [1],
  [6, 2],
  [3]
]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:
Return the 2D array where each row represents the nodes present at
that level of the binary tree, traversed from left to right.
